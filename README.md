# Unified FLUXes (UFLUX)


The UFLUX framework integrates machine learning techniques, primarily XGBoost, but also supports Random Forest and Neural Networks, alongside Earth observations and process-based baseline models, to estimate terrestrial ecosystem carbon (CO2 + CH4) and water fluxes. \
It employs AI and Earth observation data to refine baseline model predictions by comparing them to eddy covariance measurements, ensuring more accurate and consistent flux estimates. \
Additionally, UFLUX emulates international process-based models to allocate ecosystem carbon uptake across various pools. \
The framework is particularly effective for managing ecosystems, such as agriculture and high-resolution urban environments, and integrates satellite spatial resolutions for precise flux estimation across diverse landscape types.
